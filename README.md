## Expo Camera Bug: Inconsistent Blank Images with Custom Flash Modes

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API with custom flash modes.  The camera preview displays correctly, but the captured image is often blank or completely black. This behavior is inconsistent, sometimes producing a valid image and other times failing.

The issue appears to be related to how the Expo Camera API handles flash mode settings, especially when using modes beyond the standard options.  The provided code replicates the problem, and a potential solution is offered in `bugSolution.js`.

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe that taking pictures, especially with the torch flash mode, may result in blank images. 

**Potential Solution:**

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a possible workaround by adding error handling and fallback mechanisms, along with a slightly modified approach to flash mode usage.  This is not a guaranteed fix for all cases, as the root cause may lie within the Expo Camera implementation.
