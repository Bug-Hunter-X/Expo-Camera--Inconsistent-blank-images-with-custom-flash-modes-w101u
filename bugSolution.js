The solution involves more robust error handling and potentially using different approaches to setting flash modes.  For instance, trying to set the flash mode before taking a picture might help.  It is also important to handle potential exceptions during image capture.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import * as React from 'react';
import { Camera, CameraType } from 'expo-camera';

const App = () => {
  // ... (rest of the code is the same as in bug.js, except for takePicture function)

  const takePicture = async () => {
    if (cameraRef) {
      try {
        // Attempt to set flash mode before taking the picture
        await cameraRef.setFlashModeAsync(Camera.Constants.FlashMode.torch);
        let photo = await cameraRef.takePictureAsync({
          // flashMode is omitted here since we already set it above
        });
        setPhoto(photo.uri);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error taking picture:', error);
        // Handle the error appropriately, e.g., display a message to the user.
        alert('Failed to take picture. Please try again.');
      }
    }
  };

  // ... (rest of the code remains the same)
};
```
This improved solution provides better error handling and attempts to set the flash mode explicitly before capturing the image.
